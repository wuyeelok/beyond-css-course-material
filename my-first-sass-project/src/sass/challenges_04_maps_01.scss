// For this mixin to work, you will have to:

// First, check if the value is in the map, and if it is, we can use that. This is like what we saw in the previous lessons.
// If it is NOT in the map, we want to check if the value is a number or not.
// If it is a number, we can use that number.
// And to step it up even more, when we check if that value is a number, we can also look to see if itâ€™s unitless or not.
// If it is a number, but has no unit, we can print an error saying what the issue is.
// Otherwise, we can print an error saying that the value is not in the map, or a unit with a number.
